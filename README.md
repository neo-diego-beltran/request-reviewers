# Request Reviewers

## For Developing

You need to build the new version of the action before publishing/releasing

- Install `vercel/ncc` by running this command in your terminal `npm i -g @vercel/ncc`

- Compile your index.js file `ncc build index.js --license LICENSE`

- You'll see a new `dist/index.js` file with your code and the compiled modules.

- You will also see an accompanying `dist/LICENSE` file containing all the licenses of the `node_modules` you are using.

From your terminal, commit the updates to your branch.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "A nice commit message"
git tag -a -m "A nice Action release message" v[the next version]
git push --follow-tags
```
